        <h2>
            Reuben Sandwich
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nothing spells out a quick lunch more than a sandwich. And the classic Reuben is the perfect lunch break when your out and about. Corned beef or pastrami if you prefer; sauerkraut, cheese, sauce. It almost tastes like New York - if you could eat NYC!

            Steps
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare the mayonnaise by mixing all the ingredients together in a bowl minus the lemon juice. Season to taste with salt, pepper and the lemon juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the corned beef on a baking tray lined with baking paper, top generously with the cheese and grill under a salamander grill at high heat until cheese is bubbling and melting over the corned beef. <strong>Tip:</strong> if you don't have a salamander grill at home you can use an oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Liberally butter both sides of the bread and toast both sides in a frying pan over a medium heat until golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the mayonnaise with love on one side of each slice of bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top four slices of bread, mayonnaise-side up, with the cheese-toped corned beef and sauerkraut. Then sandwich the remaining slices, mayonnaise-side down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Secure with cocktail sticks, slice in half and imagine your in a NYC deli!
            </li>
